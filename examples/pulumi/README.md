# Examples

This folder contains examples of the Foundation SDK being used in combination with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/). These tools work well together because they both allow users to work in the programming language of their choice. The Foundation SDK allows users to build Grafana objects in various languages, and Pulumi allows users to invoke Terraform in various languages.

## Running the examples

From an example's folder:

```console
$ pulumi install
$ pulumi up
```
